# Kraftlin

Kraftlin is a set of focused, type-safe Kotlin libraries for building Minecraft plugins.
It provides small, composable modules for common plugin concerns like commands,
configuration, and messages.

## Quickstart

- Pick the module you need and add it as a dependency.
- Use the Paper integrations if you are building for Paper.
- Keep database credentials in a separate `database.yml` for safer operations.

## Modules

- Config: Type-safe Kotlin DSL for structured configuration.
- Command: Kotlin DSL over Brigadier with Paper helpers.
- Message: Kotlin DSL for Adventure components.
